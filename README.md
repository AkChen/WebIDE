# WebIDE
WebIDE is an interactive IDE that allows users to execute code written on the browser side and interact with a pseudo-terminal on the browser side. This project currently supports only Windows, and if you need to support Linux, you need to rewrite ptlib. The source of ptlib is in my github.
